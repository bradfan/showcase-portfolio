      <h1>About Brad Tomlinson</h1>
      <p>
        I have a wealth of attributes which I have earned through a lifetime of
        experiences; my work history and my accomplishments reflect my desire to
        learn and ability to contribute in a team environment. I am interested
        in working with a company that will allow me to grow with them, both
        professionally and technically. I have a proven track record of
        contributing to many organizations through perseverance, communication
        and dedication to the task at hand whether it be large or small. When I
        am not on job I love outdoor activities such as hiking, camping and
        kayaking and when I am around the house I enjoy playing music, working
        on my Jeep and barbequing meals for my family.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not afraid to break a sweat or get my hands dirty; please contact
        me if you would like to learn more about how I can be of benefit to your
        company.
