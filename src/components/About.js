      <p>
        I have a wealth of attributes which I have earned through a lifetime of
        experiences; my work history and my accomplishments reflect my desire to
        learn and ability to contribute in a team environment. I am interested
        in working with a company that will allow me to grow with them, both
        professionally and technically. I have recently studied JavaScript,
        ES6+, CSS3, HTML5, SQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Express, React, Node,
        Handlebars, JQuery & Bootstrap and I continue to improve and learn more
        technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a proven track record of contributing to many organizations
        through perseverance, communication and dedication to the tasks at hand;
        no job is too large or too small. When I am not on the job I love
        outdoor activities such as hiking, camping and kayaking; when I am
        around the house I enjoy playing music, working on my Jeep, home
        improvements and barbequing meals for my family.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not afraid to break a sweat or get my hands dirty. Contact me if
        you would like to learn more about me and how I can be of benefit to
        your company.
